# Backtester

This project works as a backtester for my crypto trading algorithms based on the data on Binance platform

Is beeing tested on python 3.9.5

For this project to work, it needs a config.json file with the credentials to access Binance

It downloads 1 minute candles from the begining of time and stores it into a local sqlite database in order to avoid making too many requests to binance platform
